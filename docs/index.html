    <p>
        Conway’s Game of Life is a simulation of an ecosystem that consists of
        binary cells on a toroidal grid. Cells exhibit the following behaviour:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A live cell with less than two live neighbours will die due to
            underpopulation;
        </li>
        <li>
            A live cell with two or three live neighbours will live on;
        </li>
        <li>
            A live cell with more than three neighbours will die due to
            overpopulation;
        </li>
        <li>
            A dead cell with three live neighbours will gain life
            through reproduction.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can interact with the simulation by pressing on cells. This will
        toggle them between live and dead states. Beware that even the tiniest
        change can cause mayhem across the ecosystem!
